###Built with love and the kitchen sink

This is a static site created with [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/), [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) and a little help from a [few](http://brizzled.clapper.org/blog/2012/03/05/using-twitter-bootstrap-with-jekyll/) [other](https://github.com/guard/guard-less) [places](https://github.com/therabidbanana/guard-jekyll) around the web.

I decided to build this site entirely with bootstrap default styles to help get the project off the ground and help me focus on content.
